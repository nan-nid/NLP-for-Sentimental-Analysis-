# NLP-for-Sentimental-Analysis-
AIM: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Sentiment Analysis

Prerequisite Skill: Basics of NLP and text preprocessing. Understanding of classification algorithms. Proficiency in Python

Project Objective: Build a sentiment analysis model to analyze and classify sentiments in textual data. Apply NLP techniques to understand the sentiment expressed in reviews, tweets, or other text sources.

Conclusion: sentiment analysis of twitter data is accomplished by the application of natural language processing (NLP). Preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification are the multiple phases involved in this assignment. Various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms are employed in this investigation. To find sentiment scores for the tweets, we employed work-tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speechÂ (POS).
